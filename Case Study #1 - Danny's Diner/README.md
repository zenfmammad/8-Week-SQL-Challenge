**Table 1Ô∏è‚É£: sales**
<br>
The sales table captures all customer_id level purchases with an corresponding order_date and product_id information for when and what menu items were ordered.

**Table 2Ô∏è‚É£: menu**
<br>
The menu table maps the product_id to the actual product_name and price of each menu item.

**Table 3Ô∏è‚É£: members**
<br>
The final members table captures the join_date when a customer_id joined the beta version of the Danny‚Äôs Diner loyalty program.
