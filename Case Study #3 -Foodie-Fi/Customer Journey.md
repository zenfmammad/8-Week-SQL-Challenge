#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customer‚Äôs onboarding journey. Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

```sql
SELECT 
	customer_id, 
	plan_name,
    start_date,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) as rank
FROM subscriptions s
LEFT JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id= p.plan_id
WHERE customer_id IN (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)
ORDER BY customer_id ASC;
```
