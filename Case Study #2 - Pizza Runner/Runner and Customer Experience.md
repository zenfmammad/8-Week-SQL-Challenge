#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?
```sql
SELECT runner_id,
	  AVG(EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM pickup_time-order_time)) as avg_prep_time
FROM customer_orders_temp co
LEFT JOIN runner_orders_temp ro ON  co.order_id= ro.order_id
GROUP BY runner_id
ORDER BY runner_id;
```

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?
```sql
WITH  pizza_count_per_order as (
  SELECT  
  	order_id,
    order_time,
  	COUNT(pizza_id) as pizza_count
  FROM customer_orders_temp
  GROUP BY order_id, order_time)

SELECT 
       pizza_count,
       EXTRACT( MINUTES FROM  AVG(pickup_time- order_time)) as preperation_time_in_minutes
FROM  pizza_count_per_order pc
LEFT JOIN runner_orders_temp ro ON pc.order_id= ro.order_id
GROUP BY pizza_count
ORDER BY pizza_count ASC;

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ What was the average distance travelled for each customer?
```sql
SELECT runner_id,
	  AVG(distance) as avg_distance	
FROM customer_orders_temp co
LEFT JOIN runner_orders_temp ro ON  co.order_id= ro.order_id

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
```sql
SELECT 
    MAX(duration)  - MIN(duration) as difference
FROM runner_orders_temp;
```

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
```sql
SELECT runner_id,
	   ROUND(AVG(CAST(distance AS NUMERIC) / CAST(duration AS NUMERIC)), 2) || ' km/min' as avg_speed
FROM runner_orders_temp
GROUP BY runner_id
ORDER BY runner_id ASC;

#### 7Ô∏è‚É£ What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?  
```sql
WITH runner_orders as 
(SELECT r.runner_id,
	   SUM(CASE WHEN cancellation IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) as succesful_order_count,
       COUNT(order_id) as all_order_count
FROM runners r
RIGHT JOIN runner_orders_temp ro ON r.runner_id= ro.runner_id
GROUP BY r.runner_id
ORDER BY r.runner_id ASC)

SELECT runner_id,
       ROUND(succesful_order_count:: NUMERIC/all_order_count *100, 1) || '%' as percentage
FROM runner_orders;
