## Business Task
Danny was inspired by an Instagram post: ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù He loved the idea but knew pizza alone wouldn‚Äôt secure funding. So he combined it with another big idea‚ÄîUber-style delivery‚Äîand launched Pizza Runner, delivering fresh pizzas straight from his house with the help of freelance devs and local ‚Äúrunners.‚Äù

CREATE TABLE runner_orders_temp AS
